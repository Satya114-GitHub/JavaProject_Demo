----------------------------------------


Types of Companies

     - Product based
     - Service based
     - Consulting based 
     - Audit firms







Product Based Company:
---------------------------------
These companies will not have any client
They will develop projects with their own ideas
They will sell their products to customers in market

Ex : Oracle, MS, HP, Sony, Samsung etc....

These companies will use their own frameworks 
to develop projects.

In interview they will concentrate on c, c++, ds, algorithms and core java.

Service Based Comapnies
===================
Based on client requirement companies will develop projects.

Service based companies will use latest technologies to develop projects.

Bench concept will be available.

Consulting Based Companies
======================


Audit firms
===========
Income Tax








Types of Projects
============

What is a Project ?
-----------------------
Collection of software programs is called as Software project.

Why we need software projects?
-----------------------------------------
Software projects are used to reduce human efforts.

Ex IRCTC, Banking, E-Commerce, Online delivery.



In companies we can see below 3 types of projects
----------------------------------------------------
1) Scratch development
2) Maintenence projects
3) Migration projects





Scratch develop : Brand new project (5%)

 

Maintence Projects: (75%)

	- Enhancements
	- Change Requests
	- M & O (Maintence & Operations)



Enhancements : Adding new functionality in existing project.

Change Request : Chaning behaviour of existing functionality.


Dev Team - Ongoing development

M & O Team (Production issues) - support
	- Linux
	- Putty
	- WInScp
	- Splunk



Migration Projects (15%)
------------------------

Main frames --- java

Changing from one version to another version

jdk 1.6 ----- jdk 1.8

changing from one server to another server

JBoss ------ WebSphere





Joining formalities
PF details
salary account

Induction program-


RM  - Resource Manager

Bench or Resource pooling

Complaince Traings

Project Teams
-------------

1) Onshore team : Client location team
	 
	- functional team (SME) / MBA
        - developers
	- testers
	- admins
	

   BRD -- > Business requirement Document
	    Highlevel requirements
 
   
   FDD ---> Functional Design Document (SRS)
	    low level requirements

   FDD will be submitted to client for approval

   functional ppl will arrange VC with offshore         memebers to explain fdd post client approval.

 

Functional ppl will upload FDD in sharepoint.

Sharepoint : Common location for onshore and offshore memebers to exchange documents. (webapp)

	

2) Offshore team

	We will download FDD
	understand and analyze fdd
	Write our doubts in QueryLog (Excel)
	We will set up meeting with functional team
	MoM (Minutes of Meeting)
	
	Design phase (TDD)
		- Existing sytem
		- Praposed System
		- Impact on Existing System
		- Confirmations
		- Assumptions
		- Process diagrams
			- Class
			- Sequence
			- Flow
		 - Database changes
			 - New tables
			 - existing tables
		 - Screenshots


TDD has to approved by architect and functional person.


After TDD got approved, we  have to start Development.


Local Environement. === > Local Database

Unit Testing (Junit and Mockito) 

Code Review (Peer review, PMD and Sonar Qube)-
		- Quality Gateway 

Commit code to Repository (SVN & GIT & Bit Bucket)

Dev Environement  ===> Dev Box  
	DIT	(Integration Testing)

Dev artifacts 


SIT (System Integration Testing) - Testers
	- SIT TT

Bug Reporting using bugzilla or jira

QA Manager will certify our code

UAT =>User acceptance testing
		- UAT TT
Pilot = > Pre-production
	- performance testing (JMeter)

	- real data testing

Go Live == > Production (client delivery)

Project Development Procedure
-----------------------------

1) Client will provide requirements

2) Functional team will collect requirements from client

3) Functional team will prepare BRD (Business Requirement document)

BRD - Business requirement document

4) Functional team will submit BRD to client for approval.

5) Client will provide approval for BRD.

6) Functional team will prepare FDD based on BRD.

FDD - Functional design document

7) Functional will team will submit FDD to client for approval.

8) Client will provide approval for FDD.

9) Functional team will explain FDD to developers and testers in VC or Bridge call.

10) Functional team will share FDD to developers and testers.

Note : Sharepoint will be used to store project related documents.

11) Functional team will send an email to offshore team saying that fdd uploaded to sharepoint they will provide sharepoint URL also in email.

12) Developers and Testers will download FDD from sharepoint.

13) Dev & Testing team will analyze FDD.

14) Project will have Query Log where we need to write our queries. (Query Log is excel file).

Note : Query log will be there in sharepoint.

15) Daily calls will be scheduled with functional team to discuss queries mentioned in query log.

16) After every call we should send MoM.

Mom - Minutes of meeting (i.e call discussion summary)


17.1) Developers will prepare TDD 
17.2) Testers will prepare Test Scenarios

18.1) Developer will send TDD to architect and to functional team for approval.

18.2) Tester will send test scenarios to functional team for approval.


19) TDD and Test scenarios will be approved.


20.1) Developer will start development using TDD.

20.2) Tester will prepare Test cases using Test Scenarios.


21) Test Driven Development : Testers will share test cases to developers to perform Unit Testing.

22) Developers has to perform Code Review
		 - manual review (peer)
		 - tool review (sonar qube)


23) Developers will commit code to source code repository server (like SVN or GIT HUB).

24) Developers will send email to Devops team to create pipe line for our repository for deployment in Dev box.

24) DEVOPS team will create Pipe line for Deployment in Dev box.

SDET - 

25) Developer has to deploy code to Dev box using Jenkins pipe line.

26) Deveopers has to perfom DIT (Developer Integration Testing).

Repository : Repository is the place where we will store project source code.


Without these tools help, integrating and maintaing of project source code is hectic process.

Below are the Repository tools we can use for project.

CVS
Clear Case
SVN
GIT HUB
Bit Bucket  etc...



In Repositories we can store data in files format.

Any file format we can store in repository.

Repositories will maintain versions for the files.
